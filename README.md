# Pl2 Project: 
## Library Management System:
### The Library Management System is designed to streamline the operations of a library, facilitating 
 efficient management of books, patrons, and transactions. This system enhances the user 
 experience for both library staff and patrons, ensuring that all processes related to library 
 operations are handled seamlessly.
 ## The system includes the following modules:
## ##Administrative Module:
  ### a) Admins can create, delete, update, and search for librarian and patron accounts, ensuring 
accurate and secure user records.
 ### b) Admins can manage their own credentials (username and password) for secure access.
 ### c) Admins can add new books, update existing book information, and remove books that are 
no longer part of the collection.
 ### d) Admins can categorize books by genre, author, publication year, and other relevant 
criteria for easier searching.
 ### e) Admins can track the status of each book (available, checked out, reserved).
 ## ##Librarian Module:
 ### a) Librarians can check out and return books for patrons.
 ### b) Librarians can handle reservations for books that are currently checked out, notifying 
patrons when the book is available for pickup.
## ##Patron Module:
### a) Patrons can create and manage their library accounts, updating personal information as 
needed.
### b) Patrons can search for books using various filters (title, author, genre, etc.) and view 
details about each book (summary, availability).
### c) Patrons can view their check-out history, including current checked-out books and due 
dates.
### d) Patrons can renew checked-out books or request reservations for books that are currently 
checked out.
## ##User Module:
### a) All users (admins, librarians, patrons) can log in and out.
### b) Users can update their contact information and preferences.
